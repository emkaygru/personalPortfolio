# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

For this assignment, I created a Personal Portfolio to showcase my previous and current work using Bootstrap framework. 


## Directions

Within my portfolio, you will find: 


* Creation of index.html page, portfolio.html page, and contact.html page
* Utilized the use of Bootstrap to create a Nav, sections, grid layout (columns and rows and a footer)
* Confirmed each link, button and nav item works and directs the user to the correct location
* Created a Form on the contact page using Bootstrap's form
* Updated Information to reflect that of my social media, work and projects.
* Confirmed my website pages were mobile friendly and responsive
* Navigation and footer work on all pages
* Valid and Semantic HTML used

### Notes

While I know that there were images to refer to for the design, my day job is in Web Design, so I decided to break outside of those requirements but make sure that the code and content that was required was still within my code. I think this portfolio shows my ability to design well and is a great jumping off point to start from.
